The Super Lead Extractor is a web-based application designed to simplify and automate the
process of extracting email leads from user-provided email accounts. By seamlessly integrating
a robust backend built in Java with Spring Boot, a dynamic frontend powered by React, and a
reliable MySQL database for data persistence, the system ensures a smooth and efficient user
experience.
The application allows users to securely connect their email accounts, extract relevant email
leads (such as sender addresses or specific patterns), and maintain an organized log of the
extraction process. Additionally, users can monitor real-time extraction progress and export the
extracted emails in their preferred format (CSV or TXT) for further use. The system emphasizes
security, scalability, and performance, ensuring that both personal and business users can
effectively utilize their email data.
